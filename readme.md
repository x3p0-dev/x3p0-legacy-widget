# Legacy Widget Block

X3PO Legacy Widget enables the Legacy Widget block in WordPress for all block editors.  This allows users to use classic widgets in cases where plugin and theme authors have yet to port them to custom block types.  The code behind this plugin is from the [official documentation on enabling](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/widgets/legacy-widget-block/#using-the-legacy-widget-block-in-other-block-editors-advanced) the Legacy Widget block.
