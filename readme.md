# Legacy Widget Block

X3PO Legacy Widget enables the Legacy Widget block in WordPress for all block editors.  This allows users to use classic widgets in cases where plugin and theme authors have yet to port them to custom block types.  The code behind this plugin is from the [official documentation on enabling](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/widgets/legacy-widget-block/#using-the-legacy-widget-block-in-other-block-editors-advanced) the Legacy Widget block.

**Note #1:** The Legacy Widget block is a core WordPress (Gutenberg) block and not created by this plugin. For known issues or tickets related to the block itself, see the [Legacy Widget label](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/%5BBlock%5D%20Legacy%20Widget) in the Gutenberg project repository.

**Note #2:** Widget options do not appear when used with the post/page editor.  However, widget options are available via the site editor (i.e., Appearance > Editor).

**Note #3:** The widget design in the editor may not look great.  Right now, this plugin is a proof-of-concept project.

**Note #4:** Not all third-party widgets from plugins/themes will work in the editor.  This is more likely an issue with those that use custom JavaScript.  Please encourage plugin authors to migrate their plugins to custom block types.
